    <string name="background_text">For quite some time now, doctors have been relying on antibiotics to solve many illnesses common to the public, although sometimes the use of antibiotics is not necessary. By doing so, we have created a crisis of very resistant viruses that no longer are affected by these antibiotics. Thus, the prescribing of stronger and larger amounts of antibiotics has been necessary. Other times it is the patients whom do not complete their treatment as indicated dues to confusion or miscommunication with their health provider, which only increases the magnitude of the problem. The engineering students who have developed this application are working closely with the experts of Healthy House, a local organization that provides translation services in a cultural relatable form for patients in hospitals and many other health centers, in order to inform people of this social problem. The members from Healthy House are well aware of the antibiotic abuse situation and do their best to spread awareness to the patients of the central valley, so it is with high hopes that this application helps you in understanding what is antibiotic resistance and how you can help.</string>
