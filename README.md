# HealthyHost
In Cooperation with Healthy House, the Project Protect Engineering Service Learning team is working to reduce the communication gap between healthcare providers and their patients.  By creating a user-centric mobile application, the team is providing users with a list of questions and prompts to aid them in understanding the treatments by their doctors.  The app will be in four languages, English, Spanish, Punjabi, and Hmong to help address this need of our multi-ethnic community and will have basic profiles of symptoms and background information on the most prevalent bacterial and viral illnesses in the Merced community.
